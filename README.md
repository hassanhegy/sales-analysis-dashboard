sales dashboard using pivottable and pivotcharts
ðŸš€ Excited to share my first interactive Sales Analysis Dashboard built in Excel!

I created this dashboard using Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts to analyze sales performance across categories, regions, and products.

ðŸ“Š Key Insights:

Total Sales: $2.29M

Total Profit: $286K

Total Orders: 9,994

Avg. Discount: 16%

Top Performing Categories: Technology (Profit) & Office Supplies (Quantity)

This project helped me strengthen my skills in:
âœ… Data Cleaning & Preparation
âœ… Pivot Table Analysis
âœ… Dashboard Design & Visualization
